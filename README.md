# Keats Downloader
This is a project intended to automatically download all videos in a course and store them locally. Benefits include:
- Being able to playback videos at non-turtle speed (more than 2x)
- Being able to use subtitles as a semi-accurate transcript
- Being able to watch high-resolution video streams with no buffering

You still need to have logged in to your account to use this.

This project is very WIP, so instructions to follow.
